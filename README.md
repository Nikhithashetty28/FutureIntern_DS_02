Fraud Transaction Detection using Credit Card Data


This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. 
Key features include:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset and handled class imbalance to improve model performance.
Modeling: Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier to identify fraud patterns.
Evaluation: Assessed the model using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure accuracy and reduce false positives/negatives.
The goal of this project is to enhance the detection of fraudulent transactions and strengthen financial security.
